## 📌 Overview
This is a simple feedback survey form I built while learning React.  
It was originally based on an **IBM Full-Stack Developer course lab**, but I implemented it myself and made sure I fully understood each line of code.  

The main goal of this project was to practice **handling forms in React**: capturing user input, confirming submission, and resetting form state.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- React (Hooks: `useState`)
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- HTML5 & JSX
- CSS (basic styling)

---

## 🚀 Features
- Input fields for **Name**, **Email**, and **Feedback**
- Controlled components using `useState`
- `onChange` updates state in real-time
- `onSubmit` confirmation popup before submission
- Resets form after successful submission
- Logs submitted feedback to the console

---

## 🎯 What I Learned
- The difference between `onChange` (handles live input) and `onSubmit` (handles final submission).
- How to use `useState` to manage form data.
- Why radio buttons need `onChange` even if they already have a `value`.
- How to reset form fields after submission using state.
- How to create multi-line template strings with backticks and `${...}` interpolation.

## 📚 Source / Inspiration
This project started as part of an **IBM Lab** in the Full-Stack Developer program.  
I followed the lab instructions, but I typed and structured the code myself and ensured I understood each part.  
I now feel confident I could extend it further.

## 🔮 Future Improvements
- Add validation (e.g., required fields, proper email format).
- Improve the UI with CSS or a UI framework like Bootstrap or Tailwind.
- Add a "Rate Us" radio button group for additional feedback.
- Store feedback in local storage or send it to a backend API.
